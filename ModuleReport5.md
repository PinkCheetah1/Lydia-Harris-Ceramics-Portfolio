### Retrospective
- What learning strategies worked well in this module?
  Following a youtube tutorial was super helpful. A series of small tutorial made the project much easier because I got an overview I could build off of while still being able to bounce around to what was relevant for my project
- What strategies (or lack of strategy) did not work well?
  Doing this during a period of time where I couldn't get tech help ;-; Vite will be the death of me. 
- How can you improve in the next module?
  Next time, I'll plan ahead better by assuming things will break and ruin my life and making sure I have access to quick help when it happens. I'll continue to use the strategy of following youtube tutorials.
