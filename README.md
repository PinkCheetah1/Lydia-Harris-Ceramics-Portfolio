# Overview

This is an artist portfolio website using React. This program has two pages and uses Routes to move between them. The Home page has a carousel (WIP) with a link to the Gallery as well as an "about the artist" section. The Gallery page shows off all the artwork and is linked to a js file with an array containing information for the cards, making new additions easy. 

This software gave me experience with using React and styling pages with CSS. These were both new and fun skills I didn't have experience in before the project. The CSS uses primarily flexbox for the layout.
